# Crownstone Community

Crownstone Community is an organisation that maintains open-source code that can be used for nRF52 products in general and Crownstone products in particular. Most of the code allows the people within the Crownstone Community to create a smart home solution completely under their own control, including the software that runs on the hardware as well as what happens "in the cloud".

For a more detailed overview, see <https://github.com/Crownstone-Community/overview>.

# Open-source license

Most, if not all, the source code is triple-licensed under MIT, Apache License 2.0, and LGPLv3. The licenses will be made explicit per project as well (and can be seen as individual license files in the corresponding repositories).

# Commercial license

All code that is developed under auspices of Crownstone can also be acquired under a commercial license through the [Crownstone](https://crownstone.rocks) company.
